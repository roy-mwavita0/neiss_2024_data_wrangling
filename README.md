# NEISS Data Wrangling & Exploratory Data Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning, wrangling, and exploring injury surveillance data from the **National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS)**. The analysis demonstrates how raw, real-world data can be transformed into a structured, analysis-ready dataset to generate meaningful insights.

The project is designed as a **portfolio piece** showcasing practical data analytics skills using Python.

---

##  Objectives
- Clean and standardize raw NEISS injury data  
- Handle missing values and inconsistent entries  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Generate reproducible and well-documented outputs  

---

##  Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data cleaning and manipulation  
- **NumPy** – numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – interactive analysis and reporting  

---

##  Analysis Workflow
1. **Data Loading**
   - Import raw NEISS datasets
   - Inspect structure and variable definitions

2. **Data Cleaning & Wrangling**
   - Rename and standardize column names
   - Handle missing and invalid values
   - Convert data types (dates, categorical variables, numerics)
   - Filter relevant observations

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Injury trends by age, sex, and injury type
   - Distribution of injury mechanisms
   - Summary statistics and visual exploration

4. **Reporting**
   - Export results as an HTML report
   - Ensure clarity and reproducibility

---

## Key Insights
- Identification of high-risk age groups for specific injuries  
- Common injury mechanisms across demographic groups  
- Typical data quality challenges in surveillance datasets  

> Full results and visualizations are available in the exported HTML report.
